# About #

There are [inexpensive sport watches](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=shop&q=schwinn+810+gps) out there, however the software is limited to MS Windows and is [quite ugly](http://www.amazon.com/Schwinn-Tracking-Heart-Rate-Monitor/product-reviews/B006JPBALS/).

## Idea ##

All looks like [USBXpress Development Tools](http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBXpress.aspx)
from Silicon Labs was used to communicate via USB-UART bridge [cp2102](http://www.silabs.com/pages/DownloadDoc.aspx?FILEURL=Support%20Documents/TechnicalDocs/CP2102.pdf).

It seems feasible to write a proxy and transcribe all communication between the software on Windows host and device behind USB-UART bridge.

Once protocol and data format are established, code can be written to fetch data.

There are choices as how to organize things. At first it seems natural to use a database to store all results.
However the question is what DB to use? Or shall we use *ODBC* to support virtually all?
If we use *sqlite*, we can access data with HTML5.

At the end I came to conclusion that there is nothing better than plain *CSV* files named after tracks.
All can be enumerated, some deleted, are human-readable, and can be accessed from other software easily.

The problem would be how to get overall statistics?
Like it would be sweet to use [R](http://www.r-project.org/) to see trends in progress across multiple runs.

## Build

### To make Windows redistributable

1. Install Python 3.2, pip, pyserial, cx_Freeze
2. Execute `cxfreeze --compress --include-modules serial.win32 download.py --target-dir dist`

## Tasks

At this point one should not expect an exact copy of software for other OSes.

1. <del> Code proxy and transcribe communication making it possible for others to develop software independently.</del>
2. Improve [data format](https://github.com/mlt/schwinn810/wiki/Data-Format) details.
3. <del>Write some python (?) code that dumps data from serial port into *CSV*</del>
4. Write some GUI, R code
5. Export to various web sites
